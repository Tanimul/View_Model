# View Model
ViewModel is a part of Android architecture component.

# About View Model
The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes
such as screen rotations. The Android framework manages the lifecycles of UI controllers, such as activities and fragments.

# What is the purpose of ViewModel in Android?
The purpose of the ViewModel is to acquire and keep the information that is necessary for an Activity or a Fragment. The Activity or the Fragment
should be able to observe changes in the ViewModel. ViewModels usually expose this information via LiveData or Android Data Binding.
